**GNLib** is an Android library which contains useful utilities that makes Android application development easier for the typical developer. For example the [GNLauncher](https://github.com/noxiouswinter/gnlib_android/wiki/GNLauncher) can be used to launch another Activity almost as easily as calling into a function defined on that Activity. You don't have to serialize objects, attach them to the intent and deserialize on the other end etc. The [GNStateManager](https://github.com/noxiouswinter/gnlib_android/wiki/GNStateManager) will JSON-ify and store the fields of your Activity marked with the @GNState annotation to the SharedPreferences and retrieve them at your command. 

[Setup](https://github.com/noxiouswinter/gnlib_android/wiki/Setup) page has instructions on setting up a project to use the GNLib library. [Releases](https://github.com/noxiouswinter/gnlib_android/releases) page has all the the jars.
